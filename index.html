            <h1>Campfire With Support for Apple Vision Pro</h1>
        </header>
        <main>
            <p>I'm a fan of Campfire, a new VR-focused conferencing and collaboration platform. One of the reasons I
                like the app is that it uses the Meta Quest headsets, making spatial computing not only relatively
                affordable but also safer because those devices are wireless and are safer than using more expensive or
                wired headsets.</p>
            <p>Last week, Campfire announced it would begin supporting Apple Vision Pro headsets in a couple of months,
                which are better and more expensive than the Quest offerings with much better passthrough. Improved
                passthrough allows the Vision Pro to be used longer with fewer side effects, like motion sickness, and
                makes it a better choice than Quest since it focuses on the professional market.</p>

            </div>
            <p>This upgrade allows Campfire customers to enhance their experience with the Apple Vision Pro, further
                solidifying Campfire's value as a spatial computing platform.</p>
            <p>This move, well-timed with Apple's WWDC, is an excellent enhancement to a service that could eventually
                evolve into the future of videoconferencing and a vital tool for companies to help keep employees off
                airplanes. (Every time I see a Boeing story, I regret we didnâ€™t invest more in trains or use spatial
                computing more aggressively to avoid air travel in the first place.)</p>
